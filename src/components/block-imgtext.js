                    Iâ€™ve worked internationally, in-house, and remotely on projects for leading brands, agencies, and startups. I care deeply about creating well thought through and aesthetic products. I can be as involved in your project as you need me to be: from first ideas to sketches, wireframes, prototyping, and front-end tweaking.
